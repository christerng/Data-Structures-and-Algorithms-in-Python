Given: Cost of growing array from size k to size 2k is 3k cyber-dollars
Assume: 1 cyber-dollar is enough to pay for the execution of each append operation in sequence S

Justification: If we charge each append operation that does not cause an overflow 7 cyber-dollars and each append operation costs 1 cyber-dollar, there will be 6 cyber-dollars unused
An overflow operation occurs when sequence S has 2^i elements, for some integer i >= 0, and the size of the array used by S is 2^i
Doubling the size of the aray will require 3 * 2^i cyber-dollars (given)
When doubling the size of the array, there will be 6 * 2^(i-1) = 3 * 2^i cyber-dollars available

Therefore, the execution of n append operations can be paid for using 7n cyber-dollars, so the total running time is O(n)
